# Topics to be covered END






# 1. Introduction to Statistics

* Define statistics
- used to extract meaningful information 
   # Ex:- Agar school me students ke marks ka data hai, to statistics se hum jaan sakte hain average 
   # marks kitne hain, kitne students fail hue, etc.


* Types of Statistics :-
     a. Descriptive
  

     b. Inferential



* Population vs Sample
    # a. Population : Jis poori group ke baare me hum study kar rahe hain.
        # Ex: Poore India ke students.
   
    # b. Sample : Population ka chhota hissa jise study ke liye select kiya gaya ho.
        # Ex: Sirf 500 students jo randomly select kiye gaye ho.


* Variables: Qualitative and Quantitative
    - Variable wo hota hai jo change hota rahta hai
    
    (a) Qualitative (Categorical) Variable:
        - Ye quality ya category batata hai, number nahi.
        - Example: Gender (Male/Female), Blood group (A, B, O, AB)

    (b) Quantitative Variable:
        - Ye numbers me hota hai, jise measure kiya ja sakta hai.
        - Example: Height, Weight, Age, Marks


*  Scales of Measurement



# 2. Data Collection and Presentation

* Methods of Data Collection:-
  (a) Survey
      Survey me logon se directly information li jaati hai — questionnaire ya interview ke zariye.
 
  (b) Observation
    
  
  (c) Experiment

* Primary and Secondary Data 
   Primary Data :- Jo data directly source se collect kiya gaya ho — khud survey, experiment, ya observation

   Secondary Data:- Jo data pehle se collect aur publish kiya gaya ho — jaise books, reports, government records, websites, etc.




# 3. Measures of Central Tendency
- "Measures of Central Tendency" ka matlab hota hai — data ka ek central value jo poore data ko represent kare.
- Ye value hume batati hai ki data ke values kis ke aas-paas concentrate karte hain.

Common measures are:- Mean, Median, Mode


# 4. Correlation and Regression
- Correlation ka matlab hota hai do variables ke beech relationship ko measure karna.
- Yaani ek variable badhne ya ghatne par dusre variable me kya change aata hai.
- Correlation batata hai do variables ke beech relationship ki strength aur direction.

Types of Correlation:-
- Positive Correlation - ek increase hoga to dusra bhi increase hoga or ek decrease hoga to dusra bhi decrease hoga.

- Negative Correlation - ek increase hoga to dusra bhi decrease hoga

- Zero Correlation - dono variable ke bich me koi bhi relationship nhi h.

* mathematical method to find correlation
  - Karl Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (r)
  - Spearman’s Rank Correlation (ρ)

* Regression
  - Yah correlation ke base par prediction karta hai — jaise agar x ka value pata ho, \
    to y ka estimate kar sakein.

* Covariance - Covariance batata hai do variables ek saath kaise change ho rahe hain.
